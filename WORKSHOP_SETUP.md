# DataCart Storefront - Workshop Setup Guide

## Overview

The **DataCart Storefront** is a customer-facing e-commerce web application built as a Databricks App (React + FastAPI). It connects to a Lakebase Autoscaling project to serve product catalogs, manage shopping carts, and process orders.

This app is the centerpiece of the **Lakebase Branching Workshop** — attendees interact with it as customers while running through the lab notebooks. When the "Code Red" disaster scenario drops the inventory table, the storefront visibly breaks. When PITR restores the data, the storefront comes back to life.

## Prerequisites

- **Databricks Workspace**: fevm-serverless-stable (or any workspace with Lakebase support)
- **Databricks CLI**: v0.229.0+ authenticated with a profile
- **Lakebase Project**: Created by running notebook `1.1 Lab Setup Project.py`

> **Note**: The React frontend is pre-built and included in `frontend/dist/`. No Node.js
> or npm is required for workshop setup — just deploy the app as-is.

## Step 1: Create the Lakebase Project & Seed Data

Run notebook **`1.1 Lab Setup Project.py`** in the Databricks workspace. This:
1. Creates the Lakebase Autoscaling project (`lakebase-branching-workshop-<username>`)
2. Seeds 5 tables: customers, products, inventory, orders, order_items
3. Outputs the endpoint hostname and project name

Note the **project name** from the output — you'll need it for the app configuration.

**How to find your project name:** The project name follows the pattern
`lakebase-branching-workshop-<username>`, where `<username>` is your Databricks email
with `.` replaced by `-` and `@domain.com` removed. For example:
- Email: `john.doe@databricks.com` → Project: `lakebase-branching-workshop-john-doe`
- Email: `alice.smith@company.com` → Project: `lakebase-branching-workshop-alice-smith`

You can also find it in the **Lakebase UI** (left sidebar > Lakebase) then look for the project that was just created by running the first lab

## Step 2: Update app.yaml

Edit `app.yaml` with the correct endpoint and project name from Step 1:

```yaml
command:
  - "python"
  - "-m"
  - "uvicorn"
  - "app:app"
  - "--host"
  - "0.0.0.0"
  - "--port"
  - "8000"

env:
  - name: ENDPOINT_NAME
    value: "projects/<project-name>/branches/production/endpoints/primary"
  - name: LAKEBASE_PROJECT
    value: "<project-name>"
  - name: DB_SCHEMA
    value: "ecommerce"

resources:
  - name: postgres
    type: postgres
```

> **Note**: Do NOT hardcode `PGHOST`, `PGUSER`, or `PGDATABASE`. These are auto-injected
> by the Databricks Apps runtime when you add the Lakebase database as an app resource (Step 3).

## Step 3: Create the App & Add Lakebase Resource

Create the app and add the Lakebase database as a resource **before** deploying with source
code. This ensures the connection environment variables (`PGHOST`, `PGUSER`, `PGDATABASE`,
`PGPORT`) are injected on the first deploy.

1. Navigate to **Compute > Apps** in your Databricks workspace
2. Click **Create App**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `datacart-storefront`
   - **Description**: `DataCart E-Commerce Storefront - Lakebase Branching Workshop`
4. Click **Next: Configure**
5. Click **Add Resource**
6. Select **Database** as the resource type
7. Choose the Lakebase project (`lakebase-branching-workshop-<username>`)
8. Grant **Can connect** permission
9. Save

> **Why this matters**: Databricks Apps run as a service principal (SP). The SP needs a
> Postgres role in Lakebase to authenticate. Adding the database as a resource handles
> role creation and credential injection automatically. Manual `CREATE ROLE` does not
> work because the role must be registered through the Lakebase OAuth system.
>
> **Important**: By adding the resource before the first deploy in Step 4, the `PGHOST`,
> `PGUSER`, and `PGDATABASE` env vars are injected immediately — no second redeploy needed.
> If you deploy first and add the resource after, you'll need to redeploy again for the
> env vars to take effect.

## Step 4: Deploy the App

Now deploy with the source code. Choose one of the options below.

### Option A: Deploy via the Databricks UI

1. Go to **Compute > Apps > datacart-storefront**
2. Click the **Deploy** button
3. Set the **Source code path** to: `/Workspace/Users/<your-email>/datacart-storefront`
4. Click **Deploy**

### Option B: Deploy via Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs)

The project includes a `databricks.yml` bundle configuration for automated deployment.

**Before deploying**, update the target environments in `databricks.yml` to match your workspace:

```yaml
# databricks.yml — update the profile in each target to your Databricks CLI profile
targets:
  dev:
    default: true
    mode: development
    workspace:
      profile: <your-profile>    # ← Change this to your CLI profile

  workshop:
    mode: production
    workspace:
      profile: <your-profile>    # ← Change this to your CLI profile
```

> **How to find your profile**: Run `databricks auth profiles` to list available profiles.
> If you haven't set one up, run `databricks auth login --host <workspace-url> --profile <profile-name>` first.

Then deploy:

```bash
cd datacart-storefront

# Validate the bundle
databricks bundle validate

# Deploy the app infrastructure (uses the default 'dev' target)
databricks bundle deploy

# Start the app (required after first deploy)
databricks bundle run datacart_storefront
```

The bundle defines:
- **`databricks.yml`** — Main config with `dev` and `workshop` targets
- **`resources/datacart_storefront.app.yml`** — App resource definition

To deploy to the `workshop` target instead:
```bash
databricks bundle deploy -t workshop
databricks bundle run datacart_storefront -t workshop
```

### Option C: Deploy via the Databricks CLI

```bash
# Create (first time only — skip if you already created via UI in Step 3a)
databricks apps create datacart-storefront \
  --description "DataCart E-Commerce Storefront" \
  -p <your-profile>

# Deploy
databricks apps deploy datacart-storefront \
  --source-code-path /Workspace/Users/<your-email>/datacart-storefront \
  -p <your-profile>
```

> **How to diagnose**: If the storefront shows "Loading..." forever, hit `<app-url>/api/dbtest`.
> If `PGHOST` shows `NOT SET`, the resource env vars weren't injected — redeploy the app.

## Step 5: Grant SP Schema Permissions

After adding the database resource, the SP can connect but still needs explicit grants on
the `ecommerce` schema. Get the SP client ID from the app details:

```bash
databricks apps get datacart-storefront -p <your-profile>
# Look for "service_principal_client_id"
```

Then run these SQL commands on the **production branch** as the project owner
(e.g., in a Databricks notebook or the Lakebase SQL editor):

```sql
-- Replace <SP_CLIENT_ID> with the actual service principal client ID
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA ecommerce TO "<SP_CLIENT_ID>";
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA ecommerce TO "<SP_CLIENT_ID>";
GRANT ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA ecommerce TO "<SP_CLIENT_ID>";
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA ecommerce GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO "<SP_CLIENT_ID>";
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA ecommerce GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES TO "<SP_CLIENT_ID>";
```

Alternatively, run `setup_sp_roles_notebook.py` in the workspace — it automates these grants.

## Step 6: Verify the Setup

1. Open the app URL: `databricks apps get datacart-storefront -p <your-profile>`
2. You should see the DataCart storefront homepage with the **"Spring Sale"** hero banner
3. Click **"Shop Now"** to browse products with stock levels and ratings
4. Add items to cart and place a test order
5. Check the **Orders** page to confirm the order was recorded

You can also test the debug endpoint: `<app-url>/api/dbtest` — it should show
`db_connected: true` and `product_count: 50`.

## Workshop Flow — Storefront Evolution

The storefront **auto-detects schema changes** every 30 seconds. No redeployment is needed — just
run the lab and refresh the browser.

### After Lab 1.1 — Setup

**Database:** 5 tables (customers, products, inventory, orders, order_items). No reviews yet.

**Storefront shows:**
- Products with prices and stock badges (In Stock / Low Stock / Out of Stock)
- Shopping cart with checkout
- Order history with status badges
- **No star ratings** — reviews table doesn't exist yet
- **No loyalty features** — loyalty tables don't exist yet

### After Lab 3.1 — Create Branch (Data Only)

**Database:** No changes to production. A `dev-readonly` branch is created and deleted.

**Storefront shows:** No change — branches are fully isolated from production.

### After Lab 3.2 — Parallel Development

**Database:** No changes to production. Three feature branches are created:
- `dev-loyalty-reviews` — loyalty_points column, loyalty_members table, and **reviews table**
- `modify-orders` — exchange_rates table, currency FK migration
- `add-index` — price index on products

**Storefront shows:** No change — all work is on isolated branches.

### After Lab 3.3 — Schema to Prod Migration

**Database changes on production:**
- `customers` table gets `loyalty_points` column (backfilled from order history)
- `loyalty_members` table created (customers enrolled by tier: Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum)
- `reviews` table created and seeded with ~80 product reviews

**Storefront shows (new features appear!):**
- **Navbar** — Alice Smith's loyalty tier badge (e.g., "Gold") and points count
- **Homepage** — Purple "Loyalty Program Active!" banner below the hero
- **Homepage** — "Top Rated" section appears (now that reviews exist)
- **Product cards** — Star ratings and review counts appear
- **Product cards** — "Earn X pts" labels below prices
- **Product detail** — Full customer reviews section with stars and comments
- **Cart** — "You'll earn X loyalty points" summary with tier badge
- **Checkout** — Awards loyalty points after placing an order

### After Lab 3.4 — Branch Reset

**Database changes on production:**
- `customers` table gets `email_verified` BOOLEAN column (~1/3 verified)
- `orders` table gets `priority` VARCHAR column (high/medium/normal based on total)

**Storefront shows (more features appear!):**
- **Navbar** — Green "Verified" badge appears next to the loyalty tier
- **Orders page** — Each order now shows a priority badge (high = red, medium = amber, normal = gray)

### During Lab 4.1 — PITR (The Disaster)

**Database change:** `DROP TABLE orders CASCADE` — drops both `orders` and `order_items`.
Tables that **survive**: customers, products, inventory, reviews, loyalty_members.

**Storefront shows (graceful degradation):**

| Page | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **Homepage** | Top Rated still works. Best Sellers shows "temporarily unavailable" |
| **Shop** | Products still browsable with stock badges, ratings, and "Earn X pts" |
| **Product Detail** | Reviews still visible |
| **Cart** | Items still there, but checkout shows "temporarily unavailable" error |
| **Orders** | Full-page "Orders Service Unavailable" with "Continue Shopping" button |

> Key demo point: the storefront **degrades gracefully** — products are still browsable
> even though orders are gone. This is what real customers would experience.

### After Lab 4.1 — PITR Recovery

**Database change:** Orders table recreated from PITR branch, data restored.

**Storefront shows (recovery):**
- Orders page is back with full order history
- Best Sellers works again
- Checkout is functional again
- **Priority badges are gone** — PITR restored to a point before Lab 3.4

### After Lab 4.1 — Post-Recovery Migrations

**Database change:** Lab 3.4 migrations re-applied (email_verified + priority columns).

**Storefront shows (full restore):**
- Priority badges are back on the Orders page
- Verified badge is back in the navbar
- All features from the entire workshop are restored

> Key demo point: PITR recovers data to a point in time. Post-recovery, you re-apply
> any migrations that happened after the recovery point — just like replaying commits
> after a git reset.

### After Lab 5.1 — Reverse ETL with Synced Tables

**Database change:** A `promotions` Delta table is created in Unity Catalog
(`serverless_stable_339b90_catalog.ecommerce.promotions`) and synced to Lakebase
via a synced table pipeline. First synced to a `dev-promotions` branch for validation,
then promoted to the `production` branch. The synced table appears as
`promotions_synced_prod` (or `promotions`) in the `ecommerce` Postgres schema.

**Important — SP permissions for synced tables:** After the sync completes, you must
re-grant the app SP access to the new table. Synced tables are created by the Lakebase
sync pipeline (a different internal role), so `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` from Lab 1.2
does **not** cover them. Lab 5.1 Step 7 handles this with:
```sql
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA ecommerce TO "<SP_CLIENT_ID>";
```

**Storefront shows (promotions go live!):**
- **Homepage** — New "Spring Sale Deals" section with promoted products
- **Product cards** — Red sale badges (e.g., "SPRING SALE -20%", "FLASH SALE -45%") on promoted products
- **Product cards** — Original prices crossed out with sale prices in red
- **Product detail** — Promotion alert showing badge, discount %, and sale price
- **Cart** — Promoted items show the discounted sale price

> Key demo point: The marketing team updated a Delta table in Unity Catalog. The synced
> table pipeline pushed the data to Lakebase. The storefront detected the new table and
> rendered promotions. **Zero application code changes required.**

> The storefront auto-detects both `promotions_synced_prod` and `promotions` table names.

### After Lab 5.1 — Update Promotions

**Database change:** New flash sale promotions added to the Delta table, re-synced.

**Storefront shows:**
- 3 new products with "FLASH SALE" badges
- Existing promotions updated (e.g., Product 1 discount increased from 20% to 35%)
- Changes appear within 30 seconds of sync completion

## Troubleshooting

### "Store Unavailable" error on homepage
- The Lakebase endpoint may be suspended (scale-to-zero). Wait 10-20 seconds and refresh.
- Check that the ecommerce schema exists (run `1.1 Lab Setup Project.py` first).

### "Loading..." forever
- Hit `<app-url>/api/dbtest` to check connectivity.
- If `PGHOST` shows `NOT SET`: the app was **not redeployed after adding the database resource**.
  Go to Compute > Apps > datacart-storefront > click **Deploy** > confirm and deploy.
  The env vars are only injected at deploy time, not when the resource is added.
- If `db_connected: false` with "password authentication failed": the database resource
  was not added (Step 3), or the SP role was not auto-created. Remove and re-add the resource,
  then **redeploy**.
- If `db_connected: true` with `schema_error`: the SP needs schema grants (Step 5 / Lab 1.2).

### 500 errors on product pages
- Check app logs at `<app-url>/logz`
- Verify the SP has PostgreSQL roles on the ecommerce schema (Step 5)

### Spring Sale Deals section not appearing (after Lab 5.1)
- Check `/api/features` — if `promotions_active` is `false`, the SP can't see the synced table.
- Re-run `GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA ecommerce TO "<SP_CLIENT_ID>";` as the project owner
  (Lab 5.1 Step 7). Synced tables are created by the sync pipeline, not your user, so
  `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` doesn't apply to them.
- The storefront checks for both `promotions_synced_prod` and `promotions` table names.

### Cart/checkout not working
- Cart is stored in-memory on the app server. It resets on deploy.
- Checkout requires sufficient inventory stock.
